## Dependencies
- OpenSCAD software.
- `threads-scad` library by rcolyer, available at [rcolyer/threads-scad](https://github.com/rcolyer/threads-scad).

## Installation
1. Ensure OpenSCAD is installed on your system.
3. Download the `threads-scad` library as well as this `pipe-fitting-scad` library.
3. Place both libraries in the OpenSCAD libraries directory (typically at `C:\Program Files\OpenSCAD\libraries` on Windows).

## Usage
Modify the dimensional variables at the beginning of the script to customize the pipe, gasket, fitting, nuts, and threads. Example usage is provided within the script for quick testing and adaptation.
