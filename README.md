# pipe-fitting-SCAD

OpenSCAD script for generating pipe fittings parametrically. _This is meant to be an archive branch to support the JMMP Publication_

## Overview

This repository contains a script for modeling a pipe fitting assembly, complete with gaskets, threaded nuts, and customizable pipe fittings. The script is designed for use in OpenSCAD and offers extensive customization for each component while adhering to existing industry thread standards.

**Note:** By using this library, you accept full personal responsibility for its use and any resulting outcomes, and irrevocably agree to the terms outlined in the [legal disclaimer](docs/DISCLAIMER.md). _In short, you are agreeing to assume all risks associated with its use._

## Dependencies

- OpenSCAD software.
- `threadlib` library by adrianschlatter, available at [adrianschlatter/threadlib](https://github.com/adrianschlatter/threadlib).

## Installation

1. Ensure OpenSCAD is installed on your system.
2. Download the `threadlib` library as well as this `pipe-fitting-scad` library.
3. Place both libraries in the OpenSCAD libraries directory (typically at `C:\Program Files\OpenSCAD\libraries` on Windows).

## Usage

### Creating your Fitting

Modify the dimensional variables at the beginning of the pfDesigner.scad script to customize the pipe, gasket, fitting, nuts, and threads.
